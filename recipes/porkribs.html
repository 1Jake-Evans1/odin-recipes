        <li>Put pork into the smoker, and cook for 3 hours.</li>

        <li>Before closing the wrap, place butter, apple juice and brown sugar into the 'dip' in the ribs.</li>

        <li>Pull the ribs out of the wraps and cook meat side up for another 1 hour at 150f. Baste with bbq sauce throughout.</li>
